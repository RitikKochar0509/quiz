# Quiz Layout & Flow

Welcome to the Quiz Layout & Flow application! This project is designed to create an interactive quiz experience with the following features:

## Features

1. **Start Page and User Registration**
   - The application begins with a start page where users are prompted to submit their email addresses.

2. **Question Display**
   - The application presents users with a total of 15 quiz questions.
   - Questions are fetched from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=15).
   
3. **Timer Countdown**
   - A timer is prominently displayed at the top of the page, counting down from 30 minutes.
   - The quiz is designed to auto-submit when the timer reaches zero, ensuring time-bound participation.

4. **Navigation**
   - Users have the ability to navigate to specific questions within the quiz.
   - An overview panel or similar element shows:
     - Questions the user has visited.
     - Questions that have been attempted.

5. **End of Quiz and Report Page**
   - After completing the quiz or when the timer expires, users are directed to a report page.
   - The report page provides a comprehensive summary, displaying:
     - Each question alongside the user's selected answer.
     - The correct answer for each question.
     - A format that makes it easy for users to compare their answers with the correct ones.

6. **Data Source**
   - Quiz questions are dynamically fetched from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=15).
   - The question parameter from the API is used to populate questions.
   - Choices for each question are created by concatenating the correct_answer and incorrect_answers parameters from the API.
